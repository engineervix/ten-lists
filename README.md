This project provides both a CLI (using [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/)) and a webapp (using [flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)), which generate a playlist of 10 Bible Chapters (represented by 10 mp3 files) to be listened to on any given day _x_, according to [**Professor Grant Horner's Bible-Reading System**](https://sohmer.net/media/professor_grant_horners_bible_reading_system.pdf). The audio Bible is as downloaded from the [_Faith Comes by HearingÂ®_ website](http://www.bible.is/audiodownloader).

ðŸ’¥ **WARNING: DOCS ARE OUT OF DATE**: This project is currently undergoing major refactoring (See [#104](https://github.com/engineervix/Bible-Playlist-Generator/issues/104), and [Milestone 1](https://github.com/engineervix/Bible-Playlist-Generator/milestone/1))

---

> These docs pertain primarily to the CLI. I'll update the docs to be more complete, as I refactor the app (see issue [#104](https://github.com/engineervix/Bible-Playlist-Generator/issues/104) and [milestone 1](https://github.com/engineervix/Bible-Playlist-Generator/milestone/1)).
> You can see the webapp in action [here](https://ten.stockpile.pw/)

The `bible_playlist_generator.py` script also copies the files on the playlist into a new folder
so that you can carry the folder on your USB or any other device and listen anywhere (car, home theatre, phone, tablet, etc).

### Usage

From the command prompt,

```
python bible_playlist_generator.py -d x
```

where *x* is an integer that represents the day on the Bible-Reading System, as in day 1, day 2, ... day 524, etc. For example, if you want the playlist for day *37*;

```
python bible_playlist_generator.py -d 37
```

### Help

```
python bible_playlist_generator.py --help
```

### Prerequisites / Assumptions

* Python must be installed on your computer and [added to the PATH](http://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-to-add-python-to-the-windows-path) (the script has been tested on GNU/Linux and Windows<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> running Python ~2.7~ 3.6 / 3.7. I have since moved to python3. If you are still using python2, you need to [switch to python3](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/which-python/#recommendations)!).

* [Create a virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) and install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* The script requires the [`ten_lists.json`](https://github.com/engineervix/Bible-Playlist-Generator/blob/master/ten_lists.json) file. Please see the [`helpers`](https://github.com/engineervix/Bible-Playlist-Generator/tree/master/helpers) directory for details on how this JSON file was created.

* In addition to the above, it is assumed that:

  1. the Bible folder is also on the same path as the python script and the above files.
  2. the Bible folder is named `ENGESVC2DA` by default. If your Bible folder is named differently, pass the folder name as an argument to the script:

  ```bash
  python bible_playlist_generator.py -d 37 -f "Name_of_folder"
  ```

### Important Notes

* This script will only be useful to you if you use Professor Grant Horner's Bible-Reading System as the basis for your Bible Reading Plan.
* The Audio Bible version used is the 2001 ESV dramatized Bible (complete), as freely downloaded from http://www.bible.is/audiodownloader. (The size is over 2Gb)

## Extras

### `make_one_week_playlist.sh`

There's a bash script `make_one_week_playlist.sh` which allows you to create playlists for a week or whatever period you so wish. I created it because I wanted to make my playlists in advance and copy the files to my other devices and external media only once. Also, I only get to run one command and I have as many playlists as I want!

All you need to do is specify the start day as an argument to the script, as shown below:

```bash
$ ./make_one_week_playlist.sh 200
```

If you want playlists for a period longer than seven days, edit the script and modify the `$END` variable accordingly.

## Tests

Simply run `pytest` in the root directory of this repository. If you want to check the coverage and get more details of the tests, you could run

```bash
pytest -vv --cov=. --cov-report term-missing
```

## TODO

- [ ] Address [#1](https://github.com/engineervix/Bible-Playlist-Generator/issues/1). [`configparser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) might come in handy here.
- [ ] [Package](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) this project. [This is a must read](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#configuring-your-project).
- [ ] [Improve Code Quality](https://codeclimate.com/github/engineervix/Bible-Playlist-Generator/issues)
- [x] Rather than using [plain text files](https://github.com/engineervix/Bible-Playlist-Generator/tree/v0.6.2/data), find a better way of storing the Bible Chapters ([JSON file](https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2018/07/16/why-json-isnt-a-good-configuration-language/), [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html), [TinyDB](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), etc)
- [x] Create a ~~GUI frontend or~~ web service ~~[to cater for non-tech users](https://www.inc.com/drew-hendricks/building-or-enhancing-software-for-non-technical-users-is-more-important-than-ev.html)~~ in order to not only cater for non-tech users but also to listen on-the-go. See the `webapp` directory for the source code. Also see the `package.json` file.

### :boom: :construction:

- while I've moved away from using plain text files, having switched to JSON, I still need to improve the JSON code, which currently doesn't even have any error handling mechanisms.
- I used [`grunt-json-minification`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-json-minification) to minify the JSON file (This could easily be done at `json.dumps` stage). I have used it on other projects before, thus implementing it here was a trivial task. I know it's probably overkill and un-necessary to bring in all overheads that come with `node.js`, just to use one tool! However, since I intend to create a web service in the future, I might as well begin incorporating `node.js` into the workflow. **Update**: I have created a web app. Will update the docs to reflect this.
- Need to refactor this project. This is part of the outstanding tasks on the TODO list above.

**Footnotes**

<a name="#footnote1">**1**</a>: I am yet to test it on a Mac (I expect it to run just fine!). Previous versions of the script ran well on Mac OS X. However, since the major re-write of the script in September 2019, I haven't tested it on other platforms other than Ubuntu and Windows.
